# Routing Rules

## Libraries

- Use `go_router` exclusively for navigation and deep linking.
- Do not use `Navigator` 1.0 (push/pop) directly unless wrapping a legacy imperative flow is unavoidable.

## Structure

- Define a centralized `GoRouter` configuration (e.g., in `core/router/`).
- Prefer nested/sub-routes over a flat root-level route list to preserve hierarchy and back navigation semantics.
- Use separate route files or static constants for route paths/names to avoid string literals in UI code.

## Type Safety

- Prefer typed routes (using `go_router_builder` if available in the project, or strict `extra` object definitions).
- Prefer route names (`goNamed`/typed route APIs) over raw path strings where possible.
- Use path params for resource identity and query params for filtering/sorting state.
- Pass complex objects via `extra`, but prefer passing IDs and re-fetching data in the new screen's BLoC/Repository.

## Navigation Semantics

- Prefer `go`/`goNamed` for normal app navigation and deep-linkable flows.
- Use `push`/`pushNamed` when you need a result back from transient routes (dialogs, pickers, short-lived flows).
- Prefer `BuildContext` navigation extensions (`context.goNamed`, `context.pushNamed`) over direct `GoRouter.of(context)` calls.
- Keep URL path segments lowercase `kebab-case` (for example: `/user/update-address`).
